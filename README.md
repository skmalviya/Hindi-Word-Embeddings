**Task**
* Follow the above tutorial.
* The program 'training_swb.py' generates training, testing data from swb.zip wich contains transcript of switchboard corpus in order to evaluate a WE model.
* Write program to build W2V (CBOW, SG), GLOVE, FASTTEST, BLIM-TF, FLAIR and compare them on swb.zip corpus before training our own corpus.
